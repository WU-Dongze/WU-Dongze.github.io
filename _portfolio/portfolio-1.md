My major contributions to MetaLoc span three areas: 1) Model Development, 2) Mathematical Derivations, and 3) Code and Dataset Maintenance.

The development of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning with Domain Generalization (MAML-DG)
===
Addressing the challenges of vanilla MAML's slower convergence speed and suboptimal generalization capabilities (as introduced by Chelsea Fin in 2017), I enhanced the algorithm and proposed the MAML-DG. This was achieved by modifying the loss function to mimic real-time train-test domain shifts, ensuring the model's fast adaptability across diverse domains. The subsequent content shows the development and mathematical analysis of MAML-DG, proposed by me:
