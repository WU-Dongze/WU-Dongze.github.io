I'm truly excited that the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Part III, took place at my alma mater, CUHK(SZ). A heartfelt thank you to Prof. Li Haizhou, the General Chair of ICASSP 2022 and my Machine Learning course instructor, for the kind invitation! So glad to immerse myself in cutting-edge research and connect with the leading minds in signal processing!
