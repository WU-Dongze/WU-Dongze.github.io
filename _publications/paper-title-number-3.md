Click in to view my primary contributions to the **mathematical derivations** of the project

Below are the main contributions of the project:
* Developed and analyzed a two-stage competition game for competitive markets: In Stage I, firms determine carbon abatement investments; in Stage II, they engage in competition over production, pricing, and abatement levels, dynamically trading carbon permits until reaching equilibrium, based on optimization and game theory
* Derived the optimal solutions in Stage II for production, abatement ratio, trading volume, carbon prices, and a critical point deciding the unique Nash’s and Corner’s equilibria; After incorporating Stage I, derived a set of optimal function curves that clearly defines the new equilibrium type after the competition across two stages
* Proved the uniqueness of the equilibrium solutions in Stage II; Proved the monotonicity and asymptotic behavior of the functional curves defined in Stage I; Derived the dominant parameters that affect the overall equilibrium pattern
* Defined and optimized a non-trivial social welfare function w.r.t. numerous parameters, subject to a set of feasibility constraints, to help decision makers formulate the optimal carbon control policies

I contributed to three parts of the mathematical derivations of the project. To provide a glimpse into my contributions, I've outlined some of the key derivations below:

1. We established the subsequent theorem which identifies the unique Nash equilibrium in a Cap-and-Trade setting. In this context, the subscripts l and h represent firms with low and high abatement costs respectively, while the superscripts ct indicate outcomes within the Cap-and-Trade framework:

And **part of the proof of Theorem I** is given below:

3. Proof of absence of profit overshifting:

4. We derived n optimal profit functions for n firms and defined equilibrium type for the region between each two curves. (The manuscript for this section is being prepared)
