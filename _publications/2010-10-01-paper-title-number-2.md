These are the main contributions of our paper:
* Provide a theoretical analysis using the PAC-Bayesian framework and derive novel generalization bounds for meta-learning, which are further used to develop a Bayes-Optimal Meta-Learning algorithm with performance guarantees
* Developed a novel localization framework, BOML-Loc, featuring two main stages: the meta-training stage aimed at deriving an optimal hyper-posterior distribution using past environments localization tasks, and the online localization stage involving rapid fine-tuning with only a few tasks from a new environment for subsequent testing.
* Trained with only 100 tasks, the model possesses efficient training and overfitting mitigation, superior localization accuracy, and excellent generalization abilities, consistently beating state-of-the-art models trained with 10,000 tasks
