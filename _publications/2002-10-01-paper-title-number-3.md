Click in to view my primary contributions to the mathematical derivations of the project

Below are the main contributions of the project:
* Proposed permit distribution policies under competitive markets: firms choose technology types in Stage I and decide production & carbon abatement in Stage II based on competition and game theory
* Derived equilibrium solutions in Stage II for production, abatement, trading volume, and carbon permit prices by analyzing the unique Nash's and Corner's equilibriums
* Determined the number of firms opting for low-pollution technology in Stage I, considering different parameters and equilibrium solutions from Stage II
* Derived n optimal profit functions for n firms and defined equilibrium type for the region between every two curves. Proved the monotonicity and asymptotic behavior; Proved the uniqueness of the equilibrium solutions in Stage II

I contributed to two parts of the mathematical derivations of the project:
1. We derived the unique Nash's equilibrium under the Cap-and-Trade mechanism for any S, any \gamma, in the case that the number of low-abatement cost firms (m) is less than the total number of firms (n). The unique equilirbirum is:
