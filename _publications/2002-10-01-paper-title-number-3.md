Click in to view my primary contributions to the **mathematical derivations** of the project

Below are the main contributions of the project:
* Proposed permit distribution policies under competitive markets: firms choose technology types in Stage I and decide production & carbon abatement in Stage II based on competition and game theory
* Derived equilibrium solutions in Stage II for production, abatement, trading volume, and carbon permit prices by analyzing the unique Nash's and Corner's equilibriums
* Determined the number of firms opting for low-pollution technology in Stage I, considering different parameters and equilibrium solutions from Stage II
* Derived n optimal profit functions for n firms and defined equilibrium type for the region between every two curves. Proved the monotonicity and asymptotic behavior; Proved the uniqueness of the equilibrium solutions in Stage II

I contributed to three parts of the mathematical derivations of the project:
1. We established the subsequent theorem which identifies the unique Nash equilibrium in a Cap-and-Trade setting. In this context, the subscripts l and h represent firms with low and high abatement costs respectively, while the superscripts ct indicate outcomes within the Cap-and-Trade framework:

And part of the proof of Theorem I is given below:

5. We derived n optimal profit functions for n firms and defined equilibrium type for the region between each two curves. (The manuscript for this section is being prepared)
