Current localization models mainly concentrate on specific environments, overlooking their adaptation abilities in new test settings. Our objective is to introduce a localization framework with great generalization capabilities for application in unseen test environments. Below, we present our highlighted contributions:
* Proposed a new-fashioned data-driven CSI fingerprinting method for localization based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) that can adapt itself rapidly to a new and possibly unseen test environment
* Proposed Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning with Domain Generalization (MAML-DG) by modifying the loss function of MAML through imitating the real-time train-test domain shifts so that different domains are forced to converge in a similar direction, which enables faster convergence and better adaptation abilities
* Proposed Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning with Task Similarity (MAML-TS), from the view of task similarity using maximum mean discrepancy
* Conducted strong convergence analysis, testing performance analysis, and first-order optimality analysis for the loss functions of MAML frameworks; Derived theoretical error bounds of the meta-parameters of MAML and MAML-TS
