Current localization models mainly concentrate on specific environments, overlooking their adaptation abilities in new test settings. Our objective is to introduce a localization framework with great generalization capabilities in terms of minimal fine-tuning data and minimal gradient steps for application in unseen test environments. Below, we present our highlighted contributions:
* The paper introduces a pioneering localization framework called MetaLoc, which comprises of: (1) A centralized paradigm based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and (2) A distributed paradigm combining MAML with task similarity (MAML-TS) and MAML with Domain Generalization (MAML-DG)
* MetaLoc stands out from the crowd by quickly and efficiently adapting to new environments through a small number of newly collected measurements and only 10 gradient steps, which breaks through the traditional environment-specific localization bottleneck.
* Theoretical Contributions: Conduct convergence analysis, testing performance analysis, and first-order optimality analysis for the loss functions of MAML and MAML-DG; Derived an upper bound consisting of empirical terms for the theoretical generalization error of MAML, which gives insspirations of the development of MAML-TS.
* Unlimited Application potentials: MetaLoc possesses: 1) Outstanding Localization Performance 2) Highly Flexible Model Compatibility, meaning that it holds tremendous potential of future use in the whole signal processing area 3)
