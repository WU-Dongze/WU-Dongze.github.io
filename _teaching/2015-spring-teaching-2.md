My role was to instruct course tutorials weekly, hold office hours to answer students' questions, and grade the homework. 

This course covers: Supervised Learning Models, Unsupervised Learning Models, Convolutional Neural Networks, Gaussian Mixture Models, Expectation Maximization, Principal Component Analysis, and Statistical Analysis of the algorithm. Optimization Theories and statistical derivations are stressed to help students gain deeper understandings. Homework projects require students to manually implement multiple algorithms.
