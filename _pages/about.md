I am currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics at the University of Oxford, conducting research within the [Oxford Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (OxCSML)](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning/10) group. Prior to my studies at Oxford, I obtained my bachelor's degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK(SZ)).

During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to contribute as a research assistant at the Future Network of Intelligence Institute (FNii) at CUHK(SZ), where I worked under the guidance of [Prof. CUI Shuguang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Fellow of The Canadian Academy of Engineering; Fellow of The Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada; IEEE Fellow) and [Prof. YIN Feng](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) from June 2022 to September 2023. Before that, I gained valuable experience as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Costas Courcoubetis](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/473), from January 2022 to October 2022.

My research interests encompass both theoretical foundations and practical applications. I am committed to developing innovative statistical algorithms, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian methodologies and PAC learning. I also enjoy providing rigorous mathematical analyses for model evaluations. My enthusiasm also extends to the practical applications of statistical ML algorithms, especially in fields such as signal processing, neuroscience, biomedical, biostatistics, healthcare, and computational astronomy, etc. These intriguing domains captivate me immensely!
