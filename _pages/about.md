I am currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics at the **University of Oxford**, conducting research within the [Oxford Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (OxCSML)](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning/10) group. Prior to my studies at Oxford, I obtained my bachelor's degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**.

I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant at the Future Network of Intelligence Institute (FNii) at CUHK, where I was hornored to be supervised by [Prof. CUI Shuguang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Fellow of The Canadian Academy of Engineering; Fellow of The Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada; IEEE Fellow) and [Prof. YIN Feng](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) from June 2022 to September 2023. Before that, I gained valuable research experience under the supervision of [Prof. Costas Courcoubetis](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/473), from January 2022 to October 2022.

Research Interests
======
In my previous projects, I made substantial contributions to the mathematical analyses of algorithms, setting the stage for advanced model development. I am deeply attracted to mathematical rigor and aim to develop innovative and efficient statistical algorithms, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian methodologies, Gaussian Processes, and PAC learning.

My research interests also extend to their exciting applications in fields such as signal processing, computational neuroscience, biostatistics, healthcare, and computational astronomy. I am deeply driven by my curiosity to explore the unknown world!
